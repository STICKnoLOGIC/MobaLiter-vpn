## Samsung Phones (android version 5.0(Lollipop) and later)
*Even though Samsung phones are among the most selling Android phones, Samsung's firmware are also among the most buggy Android firmwares. The bugs are not limited to the VPN operation on these devices but many of them can be workarounded. In the following some of these bugs are described. DNS does not work unless the DNS server in the VPN range. On Many Samsung 6.x devices the allowed/disallowed apps feature does not work. On Samsung 6.x VPN is reported not to work unless the VPN app is exempted from Powersave features.

## Duplicate notifications?
* if Android is under system memory (RAM) pressure, apps and services which are not needed at the moment are removed fromactiv memory. This terminates ongoing VPN connection. To ensure that the connection/OpenVPN survive the service runs with higher priority. To run with higher priority the application must display a notification. the key notification icon is imposed by the system. it does not count as app notification for purpose of running with higher priority.

## Why it drains my battery so fast?
* The reason why the high battery consumption is due to keepalive packets of OpenVPN. most OpenVPN servers have a configuration directive like 'keepalive 10 60' which cause the client and server to exchange keepalive packets ever ten seconds. While these packets are small and do not use muxh traffic, they keep the mobile radio network busy and increase the energy consumption.

## VPN and Tethering
* Tethring works while the VPN is active. The tethered connection will NOT use the VPN.

## Broken Images
* It Occurs after the app update, as we save the fetched server information in the app for future use, we save the server's flag in Integer form which is equivalent of the resource id of the flag in current version. to fix this, you need to change/refresh the server list and select a new server.
